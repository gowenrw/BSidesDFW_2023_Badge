# Solving the Crypto Challenge

This is a faily simple challenge designed to make people thing about the steps involved in working with hidden codes.

It utilizes charachter substitution with simple cryptogrophy and includes visible hints.

## Cryptogram

The first thing you will notice about this challenge is that the cryptogram is presented in HEX.

```
                  F1 0F CA 0B 1C 0F
                  CA 0B CA 00 0B 07
                  03 06 13 CA 0C 09
                  1F 08 0E CA 1E 09
                  01 0F 1E 02 0F 1C
                  CA 0C 13 CA 0D 1C
0F 0B 1E 03 10 03 1E 13 CA 0B 08 0E
CA 03 08 08 09 10 0B 1E 03 09 08 C8
```

The use of HEX is a hint as to the use of character substitution as these can be converted to ASCII characters.

But to do that conversion now will produce giberish, meaning that we must first decode it.

## Layout

The layout of the HEX is in 6 rows of 6 values followed by 2 rows of 12 values.

This was done purposley to make the number 6 stand out as important as well as to bring the concept of shifting to mind as the layout shifts from 6 to 12.

These are hints to the cipher used and the key to decrypt it.

# Cipher

The shift from the layout is hinting at a very old and famous character shifting cipher called the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

The number 6 importance from the layout is hinting at the key.  That is the number of positions to shift.

The fact that we are working with HEX means we must use a HEX alphabet in our cipher: ```0123456789ABCDEF```

The Caesar Cipher can be solved on paper or with an [online tool like this one](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher).

If we decrypt the cryptogram using the Caesar Cipher and a key of 6 we will have two possible outputs based on rightward and leftward shifting.

Decoded using Rightward shift of 6
```
9B A9 64 A5 B6 A9 64 A5 64 AA A5 A1 AD A0 BD 64 A6 A3 B9 A2 A8 64 B8 A3 AB A9 B8 AC A9 B6 64 A6 BD 64 A7 B6 A9 A5 B8 AD BA AD B8 BD 64 A5 A2 A8 64 AD A2 A2 A3 BA A5 B8 AD A3 A2 62
```

Decoded using Leftward shift of 6
```
57 65 20 61 72 65 20 61 20 66 61 6D 69 6C 79 20 62 6F 75 6E 64 20 74 6F 67 65 74 68 65 72 20 62 79 20 63 72 65 61 74 69 76 69 74 79 20 61 6E 64 20 69 6E 6E 6F 76 61 74 69 6F 6E 2E
```

Note that the decoded plaintext outputs are still be in HEX format, and only one of them will be correct.

You will need to check both in the next step to find out.

# HEX to ASCII

The final step to solving the challenge is to check both the decoded plaintext HEX outputs by doing a conversion from HEX to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)

There are many tables out there that show the ASCII to HEX values.  So, you can convert the HEX manually to ASCII or use an [online tool like this one](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code).

What you will find is that the rightward shifted decode produces gibberish while the leftware shifted decode produces our final solution:

# The Solution Relevance

The solution ```We are a family bound together by creativity and innovation.``` is a quote from the [UNT About web page](https://www.unt.edu/allabout/index.html) that I thought also applied to the Security community that drive conferences like [BSidesDFW](https://bsidesdfw.com/).
